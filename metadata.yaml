  Polkadot is a web3 blockchain ecosystem.
description: |
    The charm starts the Polkadot client as a service, taking startup arguments from /etc/default/polkadot and is set by the juju config *service-args*. The Polkadot client itself is downloaded and installed from the charm config *binary-url*. See: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/ for available releases.

    The charm is capable of running all polkadot parachains by setting the service-args.
    
    Juju actions and configs are available to let the charm act as bootnode, validator, collator or rpc. The README.md has examples for this.
